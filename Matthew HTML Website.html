        <h2>What is the Open Source Movement?</h2>
        <p>The Open Source Software Movement is a global movement that advocates for software to be freely shared, improved upon, and distributed. It has fostered innovation, collaboration, and a strong community-driven approach to technology.</p>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Why Open Source Matters</h2>
        <p>Open source software allows individuals and organizations to access the source code of programs and modify them to suit their needs. It promotes transparency, encourages innovation, and breaks down barriers for those without financial resources. Some of the world’s most successful projects, like Linux and Firefox, are open source.</p>
        <p>The open source movement is about more than just software—it’s about a philosophy of collaboration, access to knowledge, and making technology more inclusive and user-focused. As a result, it has transformed industries and empowered individuals to contribute to technology in ways that were previously unimaginable.</p>
